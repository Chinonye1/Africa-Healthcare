# Africa and her beauty
Week 1

Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both aspects. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth's land area and 6% of its total surface area. With 1.4 billion people as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania. Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate, tribalism, colonialism, the Cold War, neocolonialism, lack of democracy, and corruption. Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.

#   Healthcare

In Africa, healthcare faces a lot of problems. One big issue is that governments don't have enough money, making it hard to build good hospitals and pay skilled healthcare workers. The lack of funds also means that many areas, especially rural ones, don't have good medical facilities or transportation to get people to hospitals.
There's also the constant threat of diseases like Ebola and malaria, which strain the healthcare system and show how it's not always ready to handle emergencies. Poverty is another big problem because people who don't have much money often can't afford basic healthcare, creating a cycle of sickness and financial struggle.

A significant challenge is the "brain drain," where well-trained doctors and nurses leave their home countries for better-paying jobs and a higher quality of life abroad. This makes it even harder for local healthcare systems to find qualified staff.
Public healthcare services exist in different forms across the continent, but their quality and availability vary a lot. Expatriates, people living outside their home country, often prefer private healthcare, especially in big cities and tourist areas, where hospitals are better equipped and waiting times are shorter.
With more people traveling internationally, there's a growing need for global health insurance. This kind of insurance helps people access healthcare anywhere and can even cover the cost of moving someone to a different country for better medical care in emergencies.
To solve these problems, African governments need to find ways to get more money for healthcare, improve infrastructure, and make policies that encourage skilled healthcare workers to stay in their home countries. This way, they can build stronger healthcare systems that work for everyone.
