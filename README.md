# Africa

Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both aspects. At about 30.3 million kmÂ² including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth's land area and 6% of its total surface area. With 1.4 billion people as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. The total land area is approximately 11,724,000 square miles (30,365,000 square km), and the continent measures about 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from north to south and about 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from east to west

In Africa, healthcare faces a lot of problems. One big issue is that governments don't have enough money, making it hard to build good hospitals and pay skilled healthcare workers. The lack of funds also means that many areas, especially rural ones, don't have good medical facilities or transportation to get people to hospitals.

There's also the constant threat of diseases like Ebola and malaria, which strain the healthcare system and show how it's not always ready to handle emergencies. Poverty is another big problem because people who don't have much money often can't afford basic healthcare, creating a cycle of sickness and financial struggle.

A significant challenge is the "brain drain," where well-trained doctors and nurses leave their home countries for better-paying jobs and a higher quality of life abroad. This makes it even harder for local healthcare systems to find qualified staff.

Public healthcare services exist in different forms across the continent, but their quality and availability vary a lot. Expatriates, people living outside their home country, often prefer private healthcare, especially in big cities and tourist areas, where hospitals are better equipped and waiting times are shorter.

With more people traveling internationally, there's a growing need for global health insurance. This kind of insurance helps people access healthcare anywhere and can even cover the cost of moving someone to a different country for better medical care in emergencies.

To solve these problems, African governments need to find ways to get more money for healthcare, improve infrastructure, and make policies that encourage skilled healthcare workers to stay in their home countries. This way, they can build stronger healthcare systems that work for everyone.
